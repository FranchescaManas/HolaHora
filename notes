look at my folders first

actions >> this is when you know php na.. this is where my forms from specific pages will lead to for processing the data, it calls the functions from a class.

assets >> This is where i store the css and images

classes >> This is where i store all my user functionalites and is also separated per user
        >> User class is where i store functions that are applicable for all users like login or logout
        >> Database is a parent class, it stores my connection to my database. I use MySQL
        >> Admin is a class where i store all my function specific for admin uses like CreateEmployee() as admins are the only ones who have access to creating employees
        >> Manager same lng, a class where i store functions only specific for manager functionalities
        >> Employee, ganon lng din specific sa employee functions.
